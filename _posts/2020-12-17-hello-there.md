The idea of this site is to write about whatever comes to my mind. Main topics may include Software Development, Programming Languages, Data Science. On the side you may find some stuff about long-distance running and travel.

Please keep in mind that English is not my mother language, so you can expect some mistakes, as well as some confusing text.
